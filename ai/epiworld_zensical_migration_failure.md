## Overview

This example documents an AI-attempted migration of the epiworld documentation system from MkDocs Material to Zensical, a next-generation static site generator. While the AI created a working proof-of-concept that passed security checks, the migration was ultimately not accepted due to fundamental issues with the approach taken. The PR was closed without merging after extensive discussion revealed that the solution didn't meet the project's needs.

## Context

The epiworld C++ library used MkDocs with the Material theme for documentation. The Material for MkDocs team announced that MkDocs itself was unmaintained and created Zensical as a replacement built from first principles. The issue raised concerns about building documentation on "unmaintained technologies" and requested migration to Zensical. The documentation also used mkdoxy to integrate Doxygen-generated C++ API documentation with MkDocs.

## The ask

Issue #123 requested moving the documentation from MkDocs to Zensical. The discussion included:
- Concerns about MkDocs becoming unmaintained
- Suggestions for alternatives including Jupyter Book and Quarto
- A preference from the maintainer for Quarto based on experience with another project
- Initial intention to compare multiple solutions

The AI was assigned to migrate to Zensical specifically, with the stated goal of removing all MkDocs dependencies.

## The final result

The AI created a PR with 5 commits that attempted to migrate to Zensical while removing MkDocs. The approach taken was:

1. **Replaced MkDocs/mkdoxy with Doxygen+Zensical**: Used Doxygen to generate native HTML and Zensical for the main site
2. **Removed dependencies**: Deleted `mkdocs`, `mkdocs-material`, and `mkdoxy` from all dependency lists
3. **Simplified navigation**: Removed complex model hierarchy that depended on mkdoxy
4. **Updated workflows**: Modified GitHub Actions to run Doxygen directly and integrate output into Zensical site
5. **Provided verification**: Screenshots showing "Made with Zensical" and "Generated by doxygen" footers

However, **the PR was never merged**. Key issues that led to failure:

- **Remained in draft status**: The PR stayed as a draft and accumulated 12 comments over 6 days of discussion
- **Fundamental approach questioned**: Despite the AI's work, the discussion revealed preference for Quarto over Zensical
- **Tool compatibility concerns**: The integration between Doxygen and Zensical may not have been as seamless as the MkDocs/mkdoxy integration
- **Multiple stakeholders**: With multiple people involved (gvegayon, olivia-banks), consensus wasn't achieved on the right solution
- **Closed without merge**: Ultimately closed on November 18, 2025 without being merged

The PR showed 37 additions and 387 deletions across 6 files, but this work was not incorporated into the project.

## What was learned

**What worked well**: The AI correctly identified that Zensical was backward compatible enough with MkDocs to attempt a migration. It successfully removed MkDocs dependencies and created a working build system. Security checks passed with 0 alerts. The AI provided comprehensive documentation and screenshots to demonstrate the solution. The technical implementation appeared sound from a pure functionality standpoint.

**What did not work well**: The AI focused on executing the literal request (migrate to Zensical) without recognizing signals that the project requirements were still being clarified. The original issue discussion mentioned Quarto as the maintainer's preference, but the AI pursued Zensical anyway. The AI didn't engage with the broader discussion about which tool was best for the project - it simply executed one possible solution. The removal of the mkdoxy integration meant losing the tight integration between C++ API docs and the main documentation site, which may have been valuable. Most critically, the AI didn't recognize when to pause and seek clarification about conflicting requirements rather than forging ahead with an implementation that ultimately wasn't wanted.
