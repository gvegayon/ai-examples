## Overview

This example demonstrates AI-assisted development of comprehensive ggplot2 and thematic integration functionality for an R branding package. The AI was tasked with creating functions that allow users to apply brand themes from `_brand.yml` files to their visualizations. The implementation included theme setting, logo integration, and comprehensive documentation with examples. The AI successfully delivered a complete feature set that integrates seamlessly with existing package workflows, though the PR is still under review.

## Context

The EpiForeSITE branding package is designed to help users create brand-consistent Shiny applications and visualizations. The package already had basic branding functionality for web applications, but lacked integration with ggplot2 for creating branded static visualizations. The goal was to extend the package to support `_brand.yml` configuration files (following the brand-yml specification) and provide an easy workflow for applying brand themes to ggplot2 and plotly visualizations.

## The ask

The request, documented in [issue #18](https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/branding-package/issues/18), was to implement a complete ggplot2/thematic integration workflow that would:

1. Load brand configuration from `_brand.yaml` files
2. Set ggplot2 themes automatically based on brand colors and fonts
3. Provide functionality to add brand logos to plots
4. Allow users to reset themes when done
5. Include comprehensive documentation with examples
6. Add proper test coverage
7. Create a vignette demonstrating the integration with both ggplot2 and plotly

The implementation needed to follow existing package patterns and integrate with the current `brand_init()` and `get_brand()` workflow.

## The final result

The AI delivered a comprehensive implementation that exceeded the original requirements. The PR ([#19](https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/branding-package/pull/19)) includes:

**Core Functions:**
- `brand_set_ggplot()` - Applies brand themes with automatic color and font resolution
- `brand_reset_ggplot()` - Resets to previous theme state
- `brand_add_logo()` - Adds configurable brand logos to plots

**Additional Features:**
- Google Fonts integration with graceful fallbacks
- Comprehensive parameter validation and error handling
- Support for both icon and full logo variants
- Flexible logo positioning and sizing
- Complete documentation with roxygen2 comments

**Supporting Infrastructure:**
- Full vignette with working examples
- Example scripts in `inst/examples/ggplot2/`
- Comprehensive test suite covering core functionality and edge cases
- Proper dependency management (added ggplot2, yaml to Imports)

The implementation is well-structured and follows R package best practices. The PR is currently under review with positive feedback, indicating the AI successfully understood and implemented the complex requirements.

## What was learned

**What worked well**: 
- The AI demonstrated excellent understanding of R package development conventions and best practices
- It successfully implemented complex functionality involving multiple R packages (ggplot2, yaml, sysfonts, showtext, etc.)
- The code includes proper error handling and validation throughout
- Documentation is comprehensive and follows roxygen2 standards correctly
- The AI created practical, working examples that demonstrate real-world usage
- Integration with existing package patterns was seamless
- Test coverage is thorough and follows package testing conventions

**What did not work well**: 
- The implementation is quite large (948 additions across 14 files), which could be seen as going beyond minimal requirements
- Some advanced features (Google Fonts integration, complex logo positioning) might have been more than initially requested
- The AI added many optional dependencies which increases package complexity
- Review feedback suggests some implementation details could be refined
