# Repository about AI Examples

- This repository does not contain programming code explicitly, so, unless you are asked, you should avoid writing code.

- The main contents of the repository are the examples, which are documented as markdown files. All new added examples should follow the provided template (./template.md at the root of the repository). You can use the `./human/new_epiworld_model.md` as a reference.

- Whenever you are adding a new example, make sure to fill out all the metadata fields in the template, including the authorship.

- Examples created by you should be added to the `./ai` directory. Everytime that you add a new example, ensure that you update the list of contents under `./ai/README.md`. and `./README.md`, adding a link to the new example.
