# [Title of the Example]

## Metadata

- **Author**: [Author Name, e.g., "George Vega Yon" or "GitHub Copilot" (if it is an AI-generated example)]
- **Date**: [Date in format YYYY-MM-DD]
- **AI Model**: [AI Model Used]
- **Type of application**: [Bug fix, feature addition, write text, re-factoring, etc.]

## Overview

[Overall description of the example: what was the problem being solved, what AI was used to address it, and what was the outcome. It should be no more than two paragraphs.]

## Context

[Description of the context, e.g., "We are trying to add a new feature to allow the users change the mixing patterns of an ABM...". It should also be kept concise.]

## The ask

[Description of what was the particular request or requirement, including information about the how much contextual information was given (other links, code examples, etc.)]

## The final result

[A brief veredict indicating whether the AI did the job as expected or not. This should also mention how much assistance was needed to achieve the desired outcome, for instance, whether the user had to rephrase the problem, edit code, etc.]

## What was learned

[Description of the insights gained from the experience, including any unexpected outcomes or valuable lessons. This should be organized in two parts:]

**What worked well**: [Describe factors from the user, repository, or environment that enabled success, such as clear instructions provided by the user, good examples available in the repository, well-organized repository structure, clear documentation (like copilot-instructions.md), the task being well-suited to AI capabilities, or effective feedback processes. Focus on what external factors set up the AI for success rather than AI capabilities themselves.]

**What did not work well**: [Focus on actual mistakes, glitches, or things the AI missed that required human intervention to fix. Look for evidence in user commits that modified the AI's work, user comments pointing out issues, follow-up issues/PRs addressing problems, or specific errors in the AI's approach. If there were no significant issues, it's acceptable to state that or mention minor areas for improvement. Avoid describing task complexity or scope as problems.]

## References

[Include a bullet with links to the relevant documentation, including GitHub issues, PRs, computing sessions, ChatGPT chats, etc. If possible, this should include information about what AI model was used]
