# AI Examples

This repository is a collection of real-life examples using AI. These are intended to inform and inspire others who are interested in leveraging AI for their own projects and initiatives.

## Included examples

- [New epiworld model](./human/new_epiworld_model.md) (human).
- [Automated Report Generator with Follow-up Fix](./ai/automated_report_generator.md) (AI).
- [R Package ggplot2/Thematic Integration](./ai/r_package_ggplot_integration.md) (AI).
- [Exposing C++ Function to R Interface](./ai/cpp_function_exposure_to_r.md) (AI).
- [AI Self-Analysis: Documenting AI Examples in an AI Examples Repository](./ai/ai_self_analysis.md) (AI).

## Workflow

Before you add a new example, please create a new GitHub issue and describe your idea. The examples should be added via Pull Requests.

1. Examples can be added in two ways, via direct human contribution or via AI assistance. For either case, you should use the template available [here](./template.md).

2. If you are a human adding an example, save it under the `./human/` directory. If you are an AI, save it under `./ai/`.

3. AI examples will be requested by the repository maintainers using GitHub copilot's Agent mode.

4. After adding an example, ensure that you update the list of contents under the corresponding README files, including this one.


## AI disclosure

Obviously, this project makes use of AI. Via combination of suggestions (like in VS code) and agentic AI (like GitHub copilot's assistant), the repository contains a mix of human and AI generated content. Fully generated AI documents will be clearly labeled as such.
